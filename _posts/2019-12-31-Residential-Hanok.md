Seoul has a variety of hanok villages. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is operating the Seoul Hanok Portal(http://hanok.seoul.go.kr/) to manage, promote and revitalize Hanok in Seoul. Seoul Hanok Portal introduces the current status and history of Hanok Village. It also selects ‘Best Hanok in Seoul' and introduces it every year. This is a very valuable material to look at the present of hanok. In particular, we can take a closer look at Hanok as a residence and check the inside.

Eunpyeong’s hanok is not as narrow as Bukchon’s. In particular, Hamkyong-Lu is designed as a unique and harmonious flow due to its extensive land acquisition. Good use of the relationship with the yard allowed proper placement of the connected and independent parts.
