The 'Almost-Home-Cafe' Art Sonje Center branch is a Korean-style cafe and lifestyle shop. It is good for you to stop by before going to Bukchon Hanok Village. It opened in collaboration with the Art Sonje Center as part of the space project conducted by clothing and lifestyle brand Epigrams. A small Hanok annex is hidden in the backyard next to the Art Sonje Center, just where it has been transformed into an Almost-Home-Cafe.

Surrounded by long, wonderful bamboo, the Almost-Home-Cafe is a Hanok cafe that advocates Korea’s unique slow life. Outdoor is designed as place where people gather on the floor, 'Maru' of a Hanok. You can enjoy refreshments in warm weather on the 'Maru'.

The Maru has no doors or walls, so anyone can come naturally. From old times neighbors come in and talk on the Maru after work.

The Almost-Home-Cafe seeks to reinterpret Korean classical aesthetic from a modern perspective. It produced its own atmosphere with wooden tables and chairs at Good Hand Good Mind and Hanji(Korea Traditional Paper)at Bukchon Paper Wood Gallery.

Hanok has aesthetic elements that seek harmony between nature and space, both inside and outside. Taking full advantage of these hanok features, the sunlight entering deep into hanok windows and glass windows further enhances the atmosphere of the space.

Depending on the characteristics of hanok, the menu minimized espresso drinks. Instead, they prepared signature drinks or tea with malt or mugwort ingredients and prepared traditional Korean snacks such as Gangjeong, Yakgwa and Gyeongdan for dessert.

There are three types of "snack PLATE," which is popular at the Almost- Home-Cafe. Among them, the ‘Leebuk Gyeongdan’ menu is the most popular, consisting of a Yang-gang, rice Gangjeong, and Gyeongdan. Gyeongdan is one of the kind of rice cake Koreans have enjoyed before, and it is popular among men, women and the elderly because it has sweet red beans inside the chewy rice cake.
