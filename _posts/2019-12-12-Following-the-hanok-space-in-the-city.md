### A New Concept of Hanok



We often find that space, even the city itself, is consumed in a variety of ways as content, and that meaning is recreated within a new context. Thanks to "Newtro," traditional culture and materials are more familiar than ever. Older ones are considered to be 'new cultural values of the present era' beyond just a long-preserved one.

When I think of various materials about our space and our cities, I want to talk about traditional Korean houses.

In Korea, there are attractive cities loved by travelers. Among them, Hanok Village is a travel content that tourists constantly visit and enjoy. In addition to Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, Ikseon-dong, Jeonju Hanok Village, and Andong Hahoe Village, there are other hanok villages that have a traditional culture. Not only Hanok Village, which was formed a long time ago, but also spaces featuring hanok or traditional culture have sprung up, emerging as "hot places."



In this blog, we are going to follow the various landscapes and traces surrounding hanok and record the appearance of hanok in the city as a tourist destination, residential space, and commercial facility. Furthermore, I hope to introduce various hanok spaces to travelers visiting Korea and give them special memories and meaningful time as gifts.
