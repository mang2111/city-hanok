<p>Strictly speaking, Bukchon hanok is almost not a traditional (‘old-school’) Korean house. By the end of the Joseon Dynasty, large-scale land was divided into small-scale housing sites for social and economic reasons. So that was transformed into a residential area of changed hanok around 1930, which was concentrated and miniaturized like the current Bukchon Hanok Village.</p>

<p>The landscape reflects the social landscape of high density due to the influx of people into the city center.</p>

<p>During this period, hanok was built with new materials, such as glass and tiles, were used in the hanok ordinary. (Of course traditional timber and stone was also used.) It is also called ‘urban-style hanok’ because it is made from the perspective of ‘urban housing’ using traditional materials and structures and techniques.</p>
