I"f<p>The area around Anguk Station is known as a representative tourist destination where you can enjoy traditional Korean architecture and culture. Bukchon Hanok Village, a traditional residential area in Seoul, is also located between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace. Thus, there are many commercial and public facilities that utilize hanok, adding to the old landscape of Hanok Village.</p>

<p>Fritz-Wonseo is a nice hanok cafe if you visit Changdeokgung Palace. On the first floor of the Arario Museum, if you bring Fritz’s receipt, you can get a discount on Arario Museum exhibition tickets.</p>

<p>###Korean Vintage for Fritz identity
<br /></p>

<p>Fritz is a very preferred brand. The Franz’s identity is set to start with the Korean vintage. Similar to the ’70s and ’80s, typography, color, and graphics coexist. The other branch of Fritz, Dohaw, was remodeled into a Korean traditional tile-roofed house, and the Yangjae branch is full of items that can be imagined of modern Seoul during the flower-age period.</p>

<p>Fritz won’t be seen on the road, so if you find the Arario Museum, you can go through the entrance. It’s not far from the road, but you can enjoy a cozy hanok space like a garden in the city center.The cafe space and ordering space are divided, so it’s best to order coffee after you decide on a seat. The space isn’t that wide. Fritz is a brand like the Avengers, which was founded by coffee and bakery professionals, so you can experience the best coffee and bakeries. I hope you enjoy both coffee and bakery when you visit Fritz.</p>

<p>When the weather is warm, sitting outdoors would be better for you to feel the atmosphere of hanok. Enjoying coffee and bread on the Maru is quite cool. Along with the Ondol, the Maru is considered to be the biggest feature of hanok.</p>

<p>The Maru has no doors or walls, so anyone can come naturally. After work, neighbors come in and talk on the Maru, and when there is a big event in the house, all the neighborhood people gather to prepare food. In addition, we used to take a nap on the Maru in the middle of summer, or sit on a side of the Maru on a rainy day and enjoy the pleasure of looking at the raindrops. The interior and exterior buffer, the Maru, was able to ease the boundary between people and nature, and between neighbors.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about Fritz again. The Fritz, more famous for its brand name beyond the cafe, sells a variety of beans, coffee products, and brand goods. Especially, I think it’ll be great as a souvenir because I can feel Korea’s vintage.</p>
