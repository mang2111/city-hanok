<p>We often find that space, even the city itself, is consumed in a variety of ways as content, and that meaning is recreated within a new context. Thanks to “Newtro,” traditional culture and materials are more familiar than ever. Older ones are considered to be ‘new cultural values of the present era’ beyond just a long-preserved one.</p>

<p>When I think of various materials about our space and our cities, I want to talk about traditional Korean houses.</p>

<p>In Korea, there are attractive cities loved by travelers. Among them, Hanok Village is a travel content that tourists constantly visit and enjoy. In addition to Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, Ikseon-dong, Jeonju Hanok Village, and Andong Hahoe Village, there are other hanok villages that have a traditional culture. Not only Hanok Village, which was formed a long time ago, but also spaces featuring hanok or traditional culture have sprung up, emerging as “hot places.”</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to follow the various landscapes and traces surrounding hanok and record the appearance of hanok in the city as a tourist destination, residential space, and commercial facility. Furthermore, I hope to introduce various hanok spaces to travelers visiting Korea and give them special memories and meaningful time as gifts.</p>
